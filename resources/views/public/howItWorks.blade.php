                <b>HOW TO SCORE POINTS</b><br/>
                1. If you predict SCORE MARGIN right, you score 1 point. For example, if you predict Chelsea [1] – Fulham [0] and the match ends Chelsea [4] – Fulham [3] or Chelsea [2] – Fulham [1], you will still get 1 point as the goal margin still remains the same [1].
                <br>Another example; If you predict Arsenal 1 – 1 Norwich and the match ends Arsenal 3 – 3 Norwich,
                you will still score 1 point.
                <br>Please note that if the margin is not in the exact format you predicted it,
                you will not earn any points. For example, if the match ends with Chelsea [0] – Fulham [1],
                even though the margin is still 1, but margin is in favour of Fulham, not Chelsea,
                so you will not earn any points. <br/><br>
                2. If you predict the RESULT [Win, draw, and lose] of the game right, you get 1 point.
                <br>For example, if you predict Arsenal [3] - Crystal Palace [0] and the game ends with Arsenal [2] - Crystal Palace [0],
                 you will be awarded 1 point because Arsenal still won [A win is a win, a draw is a draw,
                  a loss is a loss, whatever the score line is]. <br/><br>
                3. If you predict the SCORELINE right, you earn maximum 5 points.
                <br>For example, if you predict Man United [1] – West Brom [0] and the match ends with
                 the exact same score , you earn 5 points. Another example is if you predict
                 Chelsea [2] vs Sunderland [4] and the match ends with Chelsea [2] vs Sunderland [4],
                 you will score 5 points.
