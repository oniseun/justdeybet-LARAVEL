## How It Works (in kiosk)

- 1. If you predict SCORE MARGIN right, you score 1 point. For example, if you predict Chelsea [1] – Fulham [0] and the match ends Chelsea [4] – Fulham [3] or Chelsea [2] – Fulham [1], you will still get 1 point as the goal margin still remains the same [1]. 
Another example; If you predict Arsenal 1 – 1 Norwich and the match ends Arsenal 3 – 3 Norwich, you will still score 1 point. 
Please note that if the margin is not in the exact format you predicted it, you will not earn any points. For example, if the match ends with Chelsea [0] – Fulham [1], even though the margin is still 1, but margin is in favour of Fulham, not Chelsea, so you will not earn any points. 

- 2. If you predict the RESULT [Win, draw, and lose] of the game right, you get 1 point. 
For example, if you predict Arsenal [3] - Crystal Palace [0] and the game ends with Arsenal [2] - Crystal Palace [0], you will be awarded 1 point because Arsenal still won [A win is a win, a draw is a draw, a loss is a loss, whatever the score line is]. 

- 3. If you predict the SCORELINE right, you earn maximum 5 points. 
For example, if you predict Man United [1] – West Brom [0] and the match ends with the exact same score , you earn 5 points. Another example is if you predict Chelsea [2] vs Sunderland [4] and the match ends with Chelsea [2] vs Sunderland [4], you will score 5 points.
